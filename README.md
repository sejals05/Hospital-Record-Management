# Hospital-Record-Management
The "Hospital Queue System" is a program designed to manage a queue of patients in a hospital. It allows staff members and patients to perform various operations related to patient management. The program utilizes a queued list data structure implemented through the Node and Queue classes. It uses the pandas library for reading and writing data to CSV files. The main function serves as the entry point and provides a menu-driven interface for users.

The objectives of the program include assisting staff members in finding patient details easily, providing updates on available doctors, ambulances, and beds, and allowing patients to view the waiting list and available doctors. The information about the doctors,ambulance and number of beds can easily be updated in the code, which is then updated in the csv.

The program includes error handling to handle missing or empty files and displays appropriate error messages.

In conclusion, the Hospital Queue System is a basic program that demonstrates patient queue management in a hospital. It can be customized and expanded to meet specific requirements and can serve as a foundation for integrating with databases or adding additional functionalities.
